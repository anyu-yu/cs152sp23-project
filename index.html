<h1>Twitter Sentiments Project Proposal</h1>

<body>The main idea behind my idea is to create a model that can create tags of keywords or sentiments on twitter posts. It would be useful for developers or users to see what kind of topics users are talking about and what kind of sentiments are currently in certain types of tweets or tweets from certain users. We can leverage Twitter API to get public twitter data and use that to train our model after personally or sourcing the annotations of some of the sentiments and/or keywords. Some goals that this will work to achieve include getting accurate sentiments and keywords or certain tweets as well as being able to generate visuals that can give summaries about sentiments and keywords for certain groups or categories of tweets.
Goals:</body>

<ul>
  <li>Visualize twitter sentiments</li>
  <li>Tag keywords to certain posts</li>
  <li>Twitter user data visualization</li>
</ul>
